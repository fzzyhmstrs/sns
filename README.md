### What is it?
Symbols 'n' Stuff is a simple utility mod that adds a suite of text-based symbols that can be added to in-game `Text`.

For an example, see `symbol_example.png` in this repository. Symbols are mostly static, but there is support for animated symbols as well.

Most of the symbols are laid out for use in an enum called `SymbolMap`. Use the desired symbol from this map, or a keybind, to make a symbol text component.

Current symbols include:
* Mouse and keyboard keys, automatically rendered based on the set keybind.
* Several specific keyboard shortcuts are hard-coded into the SymbolMap
* Emi Loot condition symbols
* Empty item socket
* Item socket representations of:
  * Many vanilla items, from gems to cookies to blaze powder to skulls, music discs, mob effects and more
  * Amethyst Imbuement
  * Simply Swords
  * Generic representations of many metals, with unique rune-like designs to differentiate them
  * Generic gems
  * Elements (Ice, Fire, etc)
  * Runes from RPG Series
  * Basic colored gems in every MC color

### Roadmap
Symbols 'n' Stuff is basically feature complete _**except**_ that more symbols can be added. 

If you would like to use this mod, but have a specific set of symbols you'd like to use that isn't currently in the mod, please open an issue with the symbols you want, why you want them, etc. and I will look into adding them if feasible.
